Took at minAbundance
density in model = edensity Hydrogen ionized
Emission measure not important, can be used as scaling factor (?)
Construct lambda(T) for single wavelength.
Total Xray luminosity of the model, take emission back at the star into account

1. assume lambda is constant and integrate n^2 over line of sight (Remeber you can't see behind the star)
2. Create lambda as a function of temperature
3. integrate lambda(T)n^2dl

16-11:
Still found a total_flux dependend on pixel_count.
Need to integrate G over the wavelenth band before calculating the flux
