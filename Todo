Took at minAbundance
density in model = edensity Hydrogen ionized
Emission measure not important, can be used as scaling factor (?)
Construct lambda(T) for single wavelength.
Total Xray luminosity of the model, take emission back at the star into account

1. assume lambda is constant and integrate n^2 over line of sight (Remeber you can't see behind the star)
2. Create lambda as a function of temperature
3. integrate lambda(T)n^2dl

16-11:
Still found a total_flux dependend on pixel_count.
Need to integrate G over the wavelenth band before calculating the flux

22 - 11:
The pixel_count dependecy is probably a problem of the interpolater
Create a rotation movie
Use the other models

29-11:
angle flux plot. light curve.
color comparisons

Later:
UNITSSS V
L_x vs P or age V
See about resampling (?)

17-01:
Maybe see about inclination vs magnetic inclination

24-01:
Fit the Lx/rot (limit the paramters)
Fit dipole

31-01:
Use different bands
Fit dipole -> minimization problem; different methods, just direction, normalize everything; try model points

Mean contribution function.
Open field lines to Lx V
Lx in literature, See simbad and F16/18 for alternate names

Reiners fit has a slope close to unity -> check this !!!
Look at the minimum and maximum of the sun in its cycle
Temperature and density plot
